Xpressnet Manual Control
=====================

The XpressNet Manual Control (Wmc) is manual control for the XPressnet bus (www.lenzusa.com/1newsite1/Manuals/xpressnet.pdf) based on a Maple Mini STM32 board.
The user interface is nearly the same as with the WMC application and it's tried to reuse as many as possible library's created for WMC.

Below the development setup.
