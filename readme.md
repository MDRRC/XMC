Xpressnet Manual Control
=====================

The XpressNet Manual Control (Xmc) is manual control for the [XPressnet bus](www.lenzusa.com/1newsite1/Manuals/xpressnet.pdf) based on 

 * a [Maple Mini STM32 baord](https://www.leaflabs.com/maple/) variant from China
 * RS485 driver IC
 * AT24C256 memeory IC for storage of settings and locdata.
 * Switches for controlling functions. 
 * Pulse switch for setting speed.
 
The user interface is nearly the same as with the WMC application and it's tried to reuse as many as possible library's created for WMC.

## Tested with
 * [MDRRC-II](http://members.home.nl/robert.evers/mdrrc2.htm) OK
